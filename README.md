A repository for code used in Appendix I and J of the 2024 Petrale Sole stock assessment.

Primary data retrieval and analysis scripts are numbered in the order that they must be run. Scripts with 00 must be run before all others, but the order between them doesn't matter. Scripts without numbers are either source files, for plotting, or supplementary tests, and may need to be run after the main analysis is complete.
